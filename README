To perform this task use a build tool (Gradle or Maven).

The presented inputs.zip file contains files with data about phone numbers corresponding to email addresses, e.g.:

+1 (123) 3245-345-345 abc@domain.com, def@domain1.org

One phone number can correspond to several email addresses. There may be duplicates and empty lines, and email addresses can be separated by spaces, tabs, commas, etc.

Subfolders in the archive can contain other subfolders. These subfolders contain other attached archives, and so on.
Some files are compressed by the gzip archiver, in which case their names end with .gz.

It is necessary to generate an inputsv2.zip file, which will contain the same content as the original archive, with the following exceptions:

1. You need to change city codes in all phone numbers:

a. 101 → 401.

b. 202 → 802.

c. 301 → 321.

2. Then, put a phones.txt file containing the list of all unique phone numbers (in the following format: +1 (2345) 678901234) sorted alphabetically in the archive root.

3. Finally, put an emails.txt file containing the list of all unique email addresses sorted alphabetically with the .org domain in the archive root.
